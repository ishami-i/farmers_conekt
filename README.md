- Payments are securely processed through Flutterwave.  
- Farmers receive order notifications and prepare goods for delivery or pickup.  
- Transporters handle logistics between farmers and customers.  
- Farmers are provided with planting plans to reduce surplus and improve production planning.  

## 4. Key Features

- Product listing, browsing, ordering, and order tracking system  
- Secure online payments via Flutterwave with automated notifications
